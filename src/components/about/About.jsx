              I am a recent graduate of the coding bootcamp Epicodus. During my
              6 months of learning at Epicodus I was able to discover and
              improve my skills as a fullstack developer. While at Epicodus I
              was fully immersed in the world of programming and met some pretty
              cool people along the way.
              <br />
              <br />
              Previously, I was a public school teacher for 5 years. Mostly
              teaching 6th grade earth & space science. I discovered programming
              earlier this year and haven't looked back since. Making things on
              the internet is fun.
              <br />
              <br />I am currently located in Aberdeen, SD which is in the
              western northeast part of South Dakota. But I am open to
              relocation through employment. I live in Aberdeen with my wife and
              our two cats "Moe Moe" & "Pierogi". In my free time I enjoy
              gaming, cooking, lifting weights, binge watching Youtube, and
              rewatching episodes of the Sopranos.
